        title: Individual differences in object recognition ability
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1091129552044052590.webp?size=96&quality=lossless" /></div>

          In this line of research, I have developed completely new tests of 
          object recognition ability, applying psychometrics techniques to 
          confidently measure this ability in haptic and auditory perception. Using
          multivariate statistical techniques like confirmatory factor analysis, I 
          found that visual and haptic object recognition share about 25% of their
          variance. Interestingly, between visual and auditory object recognition 
          ability, there was an almost perfect correlation across modalities. The 
          robust relationships remain even when controlling for possible third 
          factors like general intelligence, working memory, and low-level visual 
          ability. These findings suggests that object recognition ability taps into 
          common perceptual mechanisms that extends across modalities.

        title: Modeling Individual Differences in Perception with DNNs
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          We know that there are reliable individual differences in perceptual 
          abilities but why they exist remains elusive. I am interested in using 
          the latest deep neural networks to model individual differences and ask
          what factors best account for these differences. As modeling individual
          differences with deep neural networks is a relatively new approach, I have
          worked to determine the best ways to measure differences between deep 
          neural networks, directly comparing similarity metrics used in machine
          learning, psychology, and neuroscience. In parallel, I have begun work on
          determining which factors in deep neural networks are the best to 
          manipulate when the goal is to model individual differences. To do this, I
          sampled from a large space of deep neural networks to efficiently test 
          which combination of factors result in the most consistent variations.
