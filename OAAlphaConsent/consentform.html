			<h1>Vanderbilt University &mdash; Informed Consent Form</h1>
			<p><b>Title:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing
				Different Types of Perceptual Expertise</p>
			<p><b>Principal Investigator:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Isabel Gauthier &mdash; Psychology Department
			</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 32pt; text-indent: -16pt;">This research study, conducted at Vanderbilt University
				by Prof. Isabel Gauthier, is designed to help our understanding of how people recognize objects in their
				environment. The experiment consists of one study (estimated duration is specified in the study
				description). You will first be asked to provide information about yourself (sex, age, race, native
				language, highest level of education completed).</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The specific task may vary and could involve the following:</p>
			<ol style="margin-top: 0; list-style-type: decimal;">
				<li>Questions about your ability and experience with a certain category of objects (e.g., cars, dogs,
					birds).</li>
				<li>Questions about your personality, your social interactions or how you feel.</li>
				<li>Tasks with familiar or unfamiliar objects or faces or groups of them: making simple decisions about
					the images, learning names for them, or imagining or studying images to recognize them later.</li>
				<li>Tasks with words, letters or numbers that test your knowledge of a domain or your abilities to solve
					puzzles.</li>
				<li>Tasks with sounds, requiring to match or recognize them.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Your participation is voluntary and you may discontinue participation at any time without penalty.
				Participation involves no more than minimal risk. We may contact you at a later point to let you know of
				other studies you can complete from our laboratory. You are under no obligation to complete any other
				study.</p>
			<p><b>Confidentiality:</b> The only identifying information kept based on your participation in this study
				is your Prolific ID. This study may have some support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). If
				so, your study information is protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality.</p>
			<p>This Certificate allows us, in some cases, to refuse to give out your information even if requested using
				legal means. It does not protect information that we have to report by law, such as child abuse or some
				infectious diseases. The Certificate does not prevent us from disclosing your information if we learn of
				possible harm to yourself or others, or if you need medical help.</p>
			<p>Disclosures that you consent to in this document are not protected. This includes putting research data
				in the medical record or sharing research data for this study or future research. Disclosures that you
				make yourself are also not protected.</p>
			<p><b>Compensation:</b> If you satisfactorily complete the study, you will receive the amount listed in the
				information for this study on the Prolific website. There are items on the measure designed to check
				whether you pay attention to the instructions. Individuals who miss one or more of these questions will
				not be compensated.</p>
			<p><b>Questions or Concerns:</b> You can ask questions about this research study now or any time during the
				study by e-mailing Isabel Gauthier at Isabel.gauthier@vanderbilt.edu</p>

				fairly, please contact the Vanderbilt University Human Research Protection Program Office at
